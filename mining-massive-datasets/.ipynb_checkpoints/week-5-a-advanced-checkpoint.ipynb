    "In certain clustering algorithms, such as CURE, we need to pick a representative set of points in a supposed cluster, and these points should be as far away from each other as possible. That is, begin with the two furthest points, and at each step add the point whose minimum distance to any of the previously selected points is maximum.\n",

Obviously, x and y are furthest apart, so start with these. You must add five more points, which we shall refer to as the first, second,..., fifth points in what follows. The distance measure is the normal Euclidean L2-norm. Which of the following is true about the order in which the five points are added?\n",
