That is, at timestamps 1 through 10, the element of the stream equals the timestamp, at timestamps 11 through 20, the element is the timestamp minus 10, and so on. It is now timestamp 75, and a 5 has just been read from the stream. As a start, you should calculate the surprise number for this time.\n",

Then, our estimate will be the median of the three resulting values.\n",

To make our estimate of the count of distinct elements, we hash each element to a 4-bit binary number. The element x is hashed to 3x + 7 (modulo 11). For example, element 8 hashes to 3*8+7 = 31, which is 9 modulo 11 (i.e., the remainder of 31/11 is 9). Thus, the 4-bit string for element 8 is 1001.\n",
