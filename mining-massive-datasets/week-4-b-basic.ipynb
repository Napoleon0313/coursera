Matrix M has three rows and two columns, and the columns form an orthonormal basis. One of the columns is [2/7,3/7,6/7]. There are many options for the second column [x,y,z]. Write down those constraints on x, y, and z. Then, identify in the list below the one column that could be [x,y,z]. All components are computed to three decimal places, so the constraints may be satisfied only to a close approximation.\n",

Matrix M has three rows and three columns, and the columns form an orthonormal basis. One of the columns is [2/7,3/7,6/7], and another is [6/7, 2/7, -3/7]. Let the third column be [x,y,z]. Since the length of the vector [x,y,z] must be 1, there is a constraint that x2+y2+z2 = 1. However, there are other constraints, and these other constraints can be used to deduce facts about the ratios among x, y, and z. Compute these ratios, and then identify one of them in the list below.\n",
